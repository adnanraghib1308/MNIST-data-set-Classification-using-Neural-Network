# MNIST-data-set-Classification-using-Neural-Network
I have made this project to show how different neural network models perform on MNIST dataset. Whether using deep NN help in improving the accuracy or it just increase the complexity. Furthermore I have used batch normalization and L2  regularization to avoide
